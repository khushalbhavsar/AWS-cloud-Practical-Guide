                    AWS EC2 (ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD)
================================================================================

THEORY & CONCEPTS
-----------------

1. Definition (VERY IMPORTANT - Memorize)
   - Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud to run applications.
   - It eliminates the need for physical hardware.
   - It is part of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
   >> Write this in exams for full marks.

2. Key Features of EC2
   - Scalable: Increase or decrease servers anytime.
   - Pay-as-you-go: Pay only for what you use.
   - Highly available: Runs across multiple Availability Zones.
   - Secure: Uses Security Groups and Key Pairs.
   - Fast deployment: Launch server in minutes.

3. What is an EC2 Instance?
   - A virtual machine in AWS.
   - Can run Linux or Windows.
   - Used to host:
     * Websites
     * APIs
     * Databases
     * Backend systems
   >> One AMI can launch multiple instances.

4. AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
   - A pre-configured template used to launch EC2.
   - Contains:
     * Operating System
     * Software
     * Configuration
   EXAM TRAP: Cannot launch EC2 without AMI.

5. EC2 Pricing Models (HIGH PROBABILITY QUESTION)
   +--------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Model              | Description                              |
   +--------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | On-Demand          | No commitment, Pay per hour/second       |
   | Reserved Instances | Long-term usage, Cheaper                 |
   | Spot Instances     | Cheapest, AWS can terminate anytime      |
   | Dedicated Hosts    | Physical server for one customer         |
   +--------------------+------------------------------------------+
   Most asked: Cheapest = Spot Instances

6. Storage in EC2
   +------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Storage Type     | Description                                |
   +------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   | EBS              | Persistent storage, Data remains after    |
   |                  | stopping                                   |
   | Instance Store   | Temporary storage, Data lost if instance  |
   |                  | stops                                      |
   +------------------+--------------------------------------------+
   VERY COMMON QUESTION.

7. Security in EC2 - Security Group
   - Acts as a firewall.
   - Controls inbound & outbound traffic.
   - Allows rules only - NO deny.
   - Stateful (return traffic allowed automatically).
   Professors LOVE this question.

8. Key Pair
   - Used for secure login via SSH.
   - Includes:
     * Public key (AWS stores)
     * Private key (You keep)
   WARNING: Lose private key = Cannot access server.

9. Elastic IP
   - Static public IP address.
   - Does NOT change after restart.
   - Useful for production servers.

10. Stop vs Terminate (VERY FREQUENT)
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | Action      | Description                              |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | Stop        | Instance can restart, Data remains       |
    | Terminate   | Instance deleted permanently, Data lost  |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+

11. Auto Scaling
    - Automatically adds/removes instances based on traffic.
    - Prevents server overload.
    - Improves availability.
    - Saves cost.
    >> Preferred scaling = Horizontal scaling (add servers).

12. Load Balancer
    - Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
    - Prevents crashes.
    - Improves performance.
    Architecture: User -> Load Balancer -> EC2

13. Regions and Availability Zones
    - Region: Geographic location (Example: Mumbai).
    - Availability Zone: Isolated data center inside region.
    >> Using multiple AZ = High availability.

14. Placement Groups
    +------------+---------------------+
    | Type       | Use Case            |
    +------------+---------------------+
    | Cluster    | Low latency         |
    | Spread     | Fault tolerance     |
    | Partition  | Big data workloads  |
    +------------+---------------------+
    Lowest latency = Cluster

15. User Data
    - Script that runs automatically when instance launches.
    - Used to:
      * Install software
      * Update packages
    >> Saves manual work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRACTICAL STEPS: CREATE AN EC2 INSTANCE
---------------------------------------

Step 1: Login to AWS Console
- Go to AWS Console
- Sign in to your Amazon Web Services account

Step 2: Open EC2 Service
- Search EC2 in the search bar
- Click EC2 -> Instances
- Click Launch instance

Step 3: Name Your Instance
- Example: My-First-EC2
- This helps you identify the server later

Step 4: Choose an AMI (Operating System)
Common options:
- Amazon Linux 2023 (recommended for beginners)
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04
- Red Hat / Windows
>> Select Amazon Linux -> Click Select

Step 5: Choose Instance Type
- t2.micro or t3.micro
  * Free Tier eligible
  * 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM
>> Click Next

Step 6: Create or Select Key Pair (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Key pair is used to SSH into EC2
- Click Create new key pair
  * Name: ec2-key
  * Type: RSA
  * Format: .pem
- Download & store safely
WARNING: Without this key, you cannot log in

Step 7: Configure Network Settings (Security Group)
- Allow required traffic:
  * SSH -> Port 22 -> Source: My IP
  * HTTP -> Port 80 -> Anywhere (if web server)
  * HTTPS -> Port 443 -> Anywhere

Example:
  SSH     TCP     22      My IP
  HTTP    TCP     80      0.0.0.0/0

Step 8: Configure Storage
- Default: 8 GB gp3 (enough for practice)
- You can increase later

Step 9: Review & Launch
- Review all settings
- Click Launch instance

Your EC2 instance is created!

Step 10: Check Instance Status
- Go to EC2 -> Instances
- Wait until:
  * Instance state: Running
  * Status check: 2/2 checks passed

Connect to EC2 (Linux):
  chmod 400 ec2-key.pem
  ssh -i ec2-key.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC-IP>

Important Tips:
- Always stop instances when not in use
- Never expose SSH to 0.0.0.0/0
- Keep your .pem file safe
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys (advanced)

================================================================================
                AWS IAM (IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT)
================================================================================

THEORY & CONCEPTS
-----------------

1. Definition (MEMORIZE THIS)
   - AWS IAM is a service that securely controls access to AWS resources by managing users, permissions, and roles.
   - It helps decide:
     * Who can access AWS
     * What they can access
     * How they can access
   >> Write this in exams for Direct marks.

2. Key Features of IAM
   - Centralized access control.
   - Enhanced security.
   - Supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   - Fine-grained permissions.
   - Works across all AWS services.
   IMPORTANT: IAM is a GLOBAL service (Not region-based).
   VERY COMMON MCQ.

3. Core Components of IAM (VERY HIGH PROBABILITY)

   IAM User
   - Represents a single person or application.
   - Has login credentials:
     * Password (Console)
     * Access Keys (CLI/API)
   >> Example: Developer account.

   IAM Group
   - Collection of users.
   - Permissions applied to groups automatically apply to users.
   >> Example: Developers group gets S3 access.
   Saves management effort.

   IAM Role (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
   - Temporary permissions.
   - No password or access keys.
   - Assumed by:
     * AWS services (EC2, Lambda)
     * External users
   >> Example: EC2 accessing S3.
   Professors LOVE role-based questions.

   IAM Policy
   - Document that defines permissions.
   - Written in JSON format.
   - Specifies:
     * Allow
     * Deny
     * Resources
     * Actions
   >> Without policy = No permissions.

4. Types of Policies
   +------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | Type             | Description                            |
   +------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | Managed Policies | Created by AWS or user, Reusable       |
   | Inline Policies  | Attached to one user/group, Not        |
   |                  | reusable                               |
   +------------------+----------------------------------------+
   Exam Favorite.

5. Principle of Least Privilege (VERY VERY IMPORTANT)
   - Give ONLY the permissions required.
   - Avoid full admin access.
   - Reduces security risk.
   >> Write this in descriptive answers - examiners LOVE it.

6. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - Adds extra security layer.
   - Requires: Password + OTP/device code.
   >> Must enable for root user.
   HIGH probability question.

7. Root User (VERY FREQUENT)
   - Created when AWS account is opened.
   - Has FULL access.
   Best Practices:
   - Do NOT use daily.
   - Enable MFA.
   - Create IAM users instead.

8. Authentication vs Authorization
   +----------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Concept        | Description                              |
   +----------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Authentication | Verifies identity (Username + Password)  |
   | Authorization  | Determines permissions (Can user access  |
   |                | S3?)                                     |
   +----------------+------------------------------------------+
   VERY COMMON THEORY QUESTION.

9. Access Keys
   - Used for programmatic access.
   - Includes:
     * Access Key ID
     * Secret Access Key
   WARNING: Never share secret keys.

10. Explicit Deny Rule (EXAM TRAP)
    >> Deny ALWAYS overrides Allow.
    Remember this line. Guaranteed MCQ potential.

11. IAM Roles vs Users (SUPER COMMON)
    +-------------+-------------+
    | IAM User    | IAM Role    |
    +-------------+-------------+
    | Permanent   | Temporary   |
    | Has password| No password |
    | For people  | For services|
    +-------------+-------------+
    >> Expect this question.

12. Security Best Practices
    - Enable MFA.
    - Avoid root usage.
    - Rotate access keys regularly.
    - Use roles instead of sharing keys.
    - Apply least privilege.
    Write ANY 4 = Full marks.

13. IAM is Free
    >> No extra charge.
    Often asked in MCQs.

14. Federation (Advanced but Scoring)
    - Allows login using external providers.
    - Example: Google, Facebook, Corporate login
    >> No need to create IAM users.

15. Temporary Credentials
    Provided via: STS (Security Token Service)
    Used for: Roles, Short-term access

"IAM allows you to securely manage users, roles, permissions, and access to AWS resources."

================================================================================
                    AWS VPC (VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD)
================================================================================

THEORY & CONCEPTS
-----------------

1. Definition (VERY IMPORTANT - Memorize)
   - Amazon VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where you can launch resources securely.
   - It gives full control over:
     * IP addresses
     * Subnets
     * Routing
     * Security
   >> Write this definition for Easy marks.

2. Why VPC is Used?
   - Provides network isolation.
   - Improves security.
   - Allows custom network configuration.
   - Supports public and private resources.
   - Enables hybrid cloud (connect on-premise to AWS).

3. Key Components of VPC (VERY HIGH PROBABILITY)

   CIDR Block
   - Defines IP address range of VPC.
   - Example: 10.0.0.0/16
   >> Without CIDR = Cannot create VPC.

   Subnets
   - Subdivision of a VPC.
   - Each subnet exists in ONE Availability Zone only.
   EXAM TRAP: Subnets cannot span multiple AZs.

4. Types of Subnets
   +----------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Type           | Description                              |
   +----------------+------------------------------------------+
   | Public Subnet  | Has route to Internet Gateway, Used for  |
   |                | Web servers, Load balancers              |
   | Private Subnet | No direct internet access, More secure,  |
   |                | Used for Databases, Internal apps        |
   +----------------+------------------------------------------+
   VERY FREQUENT QUESTION.

5. Internet Gateway (IGW)
   - Allows communication between VPC and the internet.
   - Attached to VPC.
   - Only ONE IGW per VPC.
   >> Needed for public subnet.

6. NAT Gateway
   - Allows private subnet instances to access the internet.
   - Prevents inbound internet traffic.
   - Must be placed in a public subnet.
   Professors LOVE this.

7. Route Table
   - Contains rules that control network traffic.
   - Every subnet must be associated with a route table.
   >> Example rule: 0.0.0.0/0 -> Internet Gateway (means allow internet traffic)

8. Security in VPC (VERY IMPORTANT)

   Security Group
   - Firewall at instance level.
   - Stateful: Return traffic allowed automatically.
   - Supports allow rules only.

   Network ACL (NACL)
   - Firewall at subnet level.
   - Stateless: Must define inbound & outbound rules.
   - Supports allow AND deny.

9. Security Group vs NACL (SUPER COMMON QUESTION)
   +----------------+----------------+
   | Security Group | NACL           |
   +----------------+----------------+
   | Instance level | Subnet level   |
   | Stateful       | Stateless      |
   | Allow only     | Allow + Deny   |
   +----------------+----------------+
   >> Expect this in exams.

10. Public vs Private Architecture (Understand This Flow)
    >> User -> Internet Gateway -> Public Subnet -> Private Subnet (Database)
    This is my favorite scenario question.

11. VPC Peering
    - Connect two VPCs privately.
    - Traffic does NOT go through the internet.
    EXAM TRAP: No transitive routing.
    (A -> B and B -> C does NOT mean A -> C)

12. NAT vs Internet Gateway
    +------------------+---------------------+
    | Internet Gateway | NAT Gateway         |
    +------------------+---------------------+
    | Public access    | Private outbound    |
    |                  | only                |
    | Bidirectional    | Outbound only       |
    +------------------+---------------------+

13. Availability & Reliability
    - VPC spans multiple Availability Zones.
    - Improves fault tolerance.
    - Supports high availability architecture.

14. Bastion Host
    - Special EC2 instance in public subnet.
    - Used to securely SSH into private instances.
    >> Acts as a gateway.

15. VPC Endpoints
    - Connect privately to AWS services.
    - No internet required.
    - Example: Access S3 from private subnet.
    Increasingly asked in exams.

16. VPC Flow Logs
    - Capture network traffic information.
    - Helps in:
      * Monitoring
      * Troubleshooting
      * Security analysis
    Stored in: CloudWatch or S3.

- Add route:
  Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
  Target: Internet Gateway
- Associate public subnet

Private Route Table:
- Create private-rt
- Associate private subnet
- (Optional) NAT Gateway later

Step 7: Enable Auto-Assign Public IP
- Go to Subnets
- Select public subnet
- Edit settings
- Enable Auto-assign public IPv4

METHOD 2: Create VPC (Quick Setup)

Step 8: VPC Wizard (Fast Method)
- VPC Dashboard -> Create VPC
- Select VPC and more

AWS auto-creates:
- VPC
- Public & Private subnets
- Route tables
- IGW
- NAT Gateway (optional)
>> Click Create VPC

VPC Key Points (Interview):
- VPC is a virtual network
- CIDR defines IP range
- Public subnet = IGW
- Private subnet = NAT Gateway
- Security via Security Groups + NACLs

VPC in One Line (Interview):
"Amazon VPC allows you to launch AWS resources in an isolated virtual network."

Real DevOps Architecture:
  VPC
  |-- Public Subnet -> ALB, Bastion
  |-- Private Subnet -> EC2, RDS
  |-- IGW -> Internet access
  |-- NAT -> Outbound internet for private subnet

================================================================================
                    AWS EBS (ELASTIC BLOCK STORE)
================================================================================

THEORY & CONCEPTS
-----------------

1. Definition (MEMORIZE THIS)
   - Amazon EBS is a persistent block storage service used with EC2 instances to store data permanently.
   - Works like a virtual hard disk for servers.
   >> Write this for Direct marks.

2. What Type of Storage is EBS?
   >> Block Storage
   Means:
   - Data stored in blocks.
   - Similar to a traditional hard drive.
   - Can be mounted to EC2.
   EXAM TRAP:
   X EBS is object storage
   O EBS is block storage
   (S3 = Object storage)

3. Key Features of EBS

   - Protects sensitive data.
   - Uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

9. EBS is AZ-Specific (VERY IMPORTANT)
   >> Volume is tied to ONE Availability Zone.
   EXAM TRAP:
   X EBS is regional
   O EBS is AZ-based

10. Can One EBS Attach to Multiple EC2?
    >> Normally NO.
    (Except special multi-attach volumes - rarely asked.)

11. Root Volume
    - Default storage attached when EC2 launches.
    - Usually an EBS volume.
    HIGH probability MCQ.

12. Stop vs Terminate Impact on EBS
    +--------------------+---------------------------+
    | Action             | Impact                    |
    +--------------------+---------------------------+
    | Stop Instance      | Data remains safe         |
    | Terminate Instance | Root volume deleted by    |
    |                    | default                   |
    +--------------------+---------------------------+
    >> Important exam point.

13. Scaling EBS
    - Increase volume size anytime.
    - Change volume type.
    - No downtime in most cases.

14. Difference: EBS vs Instance Store (SUPER COMMON)
    +------------------+------------------+
    | EBS              | Instance Store   |
    +------------------+------------------+
    | Persistent       | Temporary        |
    | Data safe        | Data lost on stop|
    | Network attached | Physically       |
    |                  | attached         |
    +------------------+------------------+
    >> Expect this question.
